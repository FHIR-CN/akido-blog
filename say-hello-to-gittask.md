Gittask is a marketplace for connecting people that need to get coding tasks done with developers who can complete these tasks.

You can use Gittask for building your website, adding a feature

Tasks may include things like:

- I have a design for a website, I need someone to help write the HTML and CSS.

- I need someone to help me add Google Maps into my Wordpress website.

- Help! I have a broken PHP site and I need someone to fix it for me.

- I need some advice for picking the best charting library

## Why we built Gittask

Developers: We want a world where you can spend a few hours on the computer and earn some money.

Companies: We want a world where companies can get high quality code written for them in a matter of hours instead of weeks.

Open Source Authors: to make "Open Source Developer" a job title and a sustainable career. We also want to make working in open source more accessible for a larger group of people who otherwise cannot afford to give their work away for free.

----

As a developer I want to be able to log into my computer and earn money at a time of my choosing from a location of my choosing.

As a founder, I want to be able to find people that are experts in certain parts of my stack, that can build those parts of my business better than I can.

As an open source author, getting paid to build what you love is an ultimate form of freedom.

## Gittask for Developers

We built gittask to help developers quickly earn money during the hours of their choosing, from a location of their choosing.

Tasks are specific to libraries and languages, so it's easy to find the perfect match for your skill set and start earning money quickly.

## Gittask for Companies

We think companies are going to love Gittask because they can reach out to specialists or even creators of these libraries or languages for help or assistance.

There’s no risk to getting started with Gittask. It’s free to sign up and free to post a task. Gittask takes care of the marketing for you by automatically posting tasks on Github, Twitter and various other marketing channels. This frees you up to work on other things and reduces your recruiting costs.

By outsourcing tasks to those who really know these projects  well, companies can operate more efficiently, saving time and money.

For example, if you’re building a website and you need to integrate with Facebook, instead of spending a couple days figuring out the Facebook API, you can just post a task on Gittask to have an expert implement it for you.

## Gittask for Open Source

We believe that open source is fundamentally changing how we write software.
…
Gittask was built on the shoulders of the open source community.
…
That’s why we are giving 10% of each completed task back to the open source community.

This 10% is distributed based on your contributions to the codebase, so if someone completes a $300 task using jQuery, $30 goes to the top contributors of jQuery. Here’s what the breakdown looks like:

## The Landscape

There are a couple of other services already out there doing similar things, so I want to talk about where we fit into the space.

### Bountysource

In a sentence, Bountysource "builds in" open source, while Gittask "builds on" open source.

Bountysource supports the open source community through paying for issues to be fixed and features to be added. If there's a lingering bug in jQuery library that's really bothering me, I'll post a bounty to sweeten the deal for whoever takes the time to fix it.

Gittask supports the open source community by leveraging a developer's expertise in an open source library or language. If I need a custom jQuery carousel for my website, I'd look to Gittask for finding a jQuery expert to get it done quickly and properly.

### Gratipay

In a sentence, Gratipay “donates” to open source, while Gittask “pays back” open source.

Formerly known as Gittip, [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com) promotes open source projects and businesses through anonymous donations. This gives people an opportunity to help support individuals working on cool projects or interesting businesses. If you’re getting a lot of benefit out of the tools that [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj) built, you might consider tipping him for his hard work.

With Gittask, you pay for the developer’s domain expertise, code, and support. You get something back

### oDesk / Elance / Freelancer.com

oDesk, Elance, and Freelancer.com are the more traditional companies that you’d look to for your outsourcing needs. For [Lapwing Labs](http://lapwinglabs.com), we used each of these services extensively to build [Levered Returns](http://leveredreturns.com).

We found that the quality on these services was very hit or miss. Often times we had to throw away or refactor the task to make it work in our application.

We can do better. After working in open source for 4 years, I believe that the open source community has the most talented and passionate developers in the world. By forging a close relationship with the community we will raise the bar and make outsourcing viable for those who are not willing to compromise on quality.

## We need your Help

You can help us. We’re a young company with a lot to learn.

We’re . We’re bootstrapping gittask with our own money



If you like this product, we’d love some twitter love.

If you’re an open source author, you can promote tasks on your repositories by adding badges to your Readme. Here’s the code to do that:
