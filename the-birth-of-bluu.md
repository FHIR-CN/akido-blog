### Bluu: The Birth
We wanted to make a app that could be usable by the end of a weekend.  The hope was get an app published to the Apple app store quickly to start learning the intricacies of beta deployment and testing, app store submission, and post-release product marketing.

After discussing ideas ranging from utility to fantasy sports apps, we decided to work on a simple game. We figured since games are downloaded 5x-10x more than other categories, it would at the least give us an established category user-base to try the game. After doing some research on other popular games like 2048 and Timberman, we wanted the game to have the following characteristics:

1. Easy to play
2. Hard to master
3. Simple graphics

We thought the flicking and combing of tiles in 2048 made for a pretty awesome experience so we wondered if matching colors instead was numbers could provide similar satisfaction. Having taken a bit of psychology in high-school and college, we remembered that it's harder to read words if they're colored differently than that what they mean.
