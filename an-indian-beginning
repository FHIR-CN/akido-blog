### An Indian Beginning
Since Brian was still finishing up work at GE, Matt and I along with Matt Hogan, our co-founder for [Levered Returns](http://www.leveredreturns.com), took to trip to Bangalore, India to start working on the Levered Returns and [Duo](http://duojs.org/) concepts. We figured it would be less distracting and give us a chance to meet some interesting people.

Below are some highlights from the trip.

#### The Taj Welcome
If you have a few hundred dollars in your pocket, I recommend staying at one of the five-star hotels in India and live like a King for couple days. Pictured below is the welcome you get at check-in.

#### Cricket!
By far India's biggest sport, it was fun playing some street ball. No, it’s not Indian baseball.

#### Rickshaw. 150 Rupees?! 100 Rupees Maximum
Our primary mode of transport around was the Rickshaw. No, not the ones where [someone cycles you around](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickshaws_in_the_United_States). The Indian kind! I don't think they’re made for three dudes our size though. Also, it's pretty hilarious negotiating with drivers, especially when the see foreigners.

#### Cobalt
Before leaving, we were planning to work at [Jaaga](http://jaaga.in/). When we showed up, we realized the co-working space had moved into someone's apartment instead. After a day of rickshawing around Bangalore, some picking each other up, and soul-searching, we finally end the search at [Cobalt](http://www.cobaltblr.com/). If you're looking for a Western style co-working space with nice people, this is it!

#### $2 Haircut and Shave
An awesome perk of living in India is the super cheap haircuts and shave. Includes haircut, massage, and shave. The Indian shaving blade can handle even the toughest hairs like Mueller's hipster mustache.

#### Random Street Dance Party
We heard a bunch of noise outside our hotel room, so we stepped out to analyze the commotion. Soon we ended up dancing and waving flags in the middle of the street. Still not sure what we were celebrating...
